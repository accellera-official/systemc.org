Accellera Systems Initiative (Accellera) announced its [SystemC Summer of Code 2025](/events/ssoc2025/) program, created for students interested in contributing to the evolution of the SystemC ecosystem. Experience in object-oriented programming and C++ is required. Applications will be accepted March 5 through April 4 by submitting a project proposal and resume.

## SystemC Evolution Day <img style="float:right; width:300px;" src="/images/sced.png">

SystemC Evolution Day events are an opportunity for the whole SystemC community to come together.
The days are intended as a lean, user-centric, hands-on forum bringing together experts from the SystemC user community, tool providers and the Accellera Working Groups to advance SystemC standards.

SystemC Evolution Day events are full-day, in person events, divided into several in-depth sessions. Selected current and future standardization topics around SystemC are discussed in order to accelerate their progress for inclusion in Accellera/IEEE standards.

SystemC Evolution Day events are co-located with [DVCon Europe](https://dvcon-europe.org), on the day after the main conference.

## SystemC Evolution Fika <img style="float:right; width:300px;" src="/images/scef.png">

In addition to our SystemC Evolution Day events, we are also continuing the SystemC Evolution with smaller, regular, online workshops. We refer to these workshops as *fikas*, to honor the fika tradition of sharing a coffee, slowing down a bit, and talking about things that we care about. These virtual events are free of charge.

If you have topics that you think should be included in upcoming fikas, please let us know at [systemc-evolution-fika@lists.accellera.org](mailto:systemc-evolution-fika@lists.accellera.org).
